# CSFML-framebuffer-boilerplate

A project with minimal code demonstrating how to use a framebuffer in CSFML while keeping a proper project architecture.

This project is particularly useful for first year epitech student with its use in projects like:

* my_screensaver
* my_radar
* my_world
* my_rpg

Thanks to this framebuffer, you have total freedom of each pixel of your screen, so you will only be limited by your math level ;)
